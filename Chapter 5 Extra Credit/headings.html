    <h1>Makoto Kikuchi is from the Idolm@ster video games series, and anime "Idolm@ster".</h1>
    <h2>Makoto grew up with a very tomboyish demeanor due to her father, so she became an idol to express and embrace her
        feminine, girly side.</h2>
    <h3>Makoto has a natural fear of insects to the point of hesitating to say the name of any insect she sees.</h3>
    <h4>Her birthday is August 29th, making her a Virgo.</h4>
    <h5>Makoto is voiced and sung by Hiromi Hirata.</h5>
