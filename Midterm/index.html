    <h3 class="aboutme">ABOUT ME</h3>
        <p> The creation of this webpage was made by me, Alize Jackson for her Midterm Project for WEB 110. I really love
        iDOLM@STER, and this class has given me a chance to utilize the HTML and CSS skills I have learned so far to create
        this small but fun webpage for all to see.</p>
